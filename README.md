## Insights

- Mission Success Rate records a 94.62% success rate across 1,000 missions, with only 48 failed missions, 19 partial failures, and 1 prelaunch failure.
- There has been a notable increase in the number of missions, especially from 2010 onwards, reflecting accelerated space exploration activities.
- CASC leads with 233 successful missions, followed by SpaceX (170) and NASA (146). These organizations have made significant contributions to global space exploration.
- The Falcon 9 Block 5 is the most active rocket with 111 missions, followed by the Ariane 5 ECA and Long March rockets.
- Missions are concentrated in key regions, with specific locations showing a higher frequency of mission launches and varying levels of financial investment.
- The majority of missions were successful, with minimal instances of partial failures, prelaunch failures, and total failures.

## Recommendations

- Future investments should prioritize collaboration with companies and rockets with proven track records, like CASC, SpaceX, and Falcon 9 Block 5, to enhance mission reliability.
- Conduct in-depth analysis of failed and partially failed missions to identify common failure points and implement targeted improvements.
- Given the substantial $162.3 billion investment, it is important to continue optimizing resource allocation and financial planning to achieve better cost efficiency.
- With a growing number of missions since 2010, space agencies should capitalize on technological advancements and increased global interest to expand their mission portfolios.
- Expanding launch sites to new regions could mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on specific locations and enhance global mission coverage.
